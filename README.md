# Convenient online autobank for offline table games

## Description
### Purpose
Our project`s goal is to ease playing offline table games by automate 
calculation of ingame points between players and bank. For example, you lost
money from your monopoly kit, or you just do not want to use paper money for some 
reason(it also can be boring and interrupting the game). That is why we decided 
to create project, that can be used on desktops and phones and not distract
you and your company from main evening(or so) event. It has convenient user interface
for points exchange.

###Technologies 

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for backend, [react](https://en.reactjs.org) for frontend 
and
[figma](https://www.figma.com/file/cvXvPlSPrZZCyA7JIGjqJ3) for designing interface.

### Future plans
In the future, we are planning to fix bugs, add more settings for
flexible tuning rules for your game to cover more existing games and that you can 
create by yourself.

## How to use it

If there is no available sites, you can deploy it by yourself(someday it will be desribed)
It there is available sites, you should go there, if someone from your comrades have
already created room, then ask him for id of room then connect to room, else 
create new room, tune settings and share room id. Then start the game.
